# Symptoms-Based Disease Prediction and Drug Recommendation System

## Project Overview
- Developed a symptoms-based disease prediction and drug recommendation system using machine learning.
- Aimed at leveraging medical databases to improve healthcare services and outcomes.

## Dataset Details
- Used a dataset with 132 symptoms and around 5000 patient records covering 41 different diseases.
- Preprocessed data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.

## Machine Learning Algorithms
- Implemented four classification algorithms:
  - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Gradient Boosting
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Evaluated algorithms for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Results
- Achieved maximum accuracies ranging up to 90% with various algorithms.
- Graphical representations included accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for comparative analysis.

## Future Scope
- Plan to enhance accuracy using deep neural networks with larger datasets.
- Explore age-specific drug recommendations for improved personalized healthcare.
